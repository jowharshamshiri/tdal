# Framework Architecture

## Overview

This framework provides a comprehensive solution for building data-driven applications with a focus on configuration-based entity management, API generation, and workflow automation. The architecture follows a modular, layered approach with clear separation of concerns to ensure maintainability and extensibility.

## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Configuration-First**: Entity definitions, relationships, and behaviors are driven by YAML configurations, reducing boilerplate code.
2. **Modular Design**: Components are designed to be loosely coupled, allowing for easy replacement or extension.
3. **Framework-Agnostic Core**: The core business logic is framework-agnostic, with adapters for specific platforms (Express, etc.).
4. **Extensible Plugin System**: The framework supports plugins and extensions for adding custom functionality.
5. **Consistent Patterns**: Common patterns are used throughout the framework for predictable behavior and easier learning curve.

## Architectural Layers

### 1. Core Layer

The core layer provides fundamental abstractions and services that are used throughout the framework.

Key components:

- **AppContext**: Central dependency container providing access to services and configurations
- **ConfigLoader**: Loads and validates configuration files
- **Types**: Core type definitions used across the framework
- **EventBus**: Publish-subscribe mechanism for system events

### 2. Data Layer

The data layer manages database connections, schema definitions, and data access operations.

Key components:

- **EntityConfig**: Definitions for entity schemas, relationships, and behaviors
- **EntityDao**: Data access objects providing CRUD operations for entities
- **DatabaseAdapter**: Abstract interface for database operations
- **Specific Database Implementations**: Concrete adapters for supported databases

### 3. Business Logic Layer

The business logic layer implements domain-specific operations and workflows.

Key components:

- **ActionRegistry**: Registry for custom entity actions
- **ActionExecutor**: Executes entity actions with transaction support
- **WorkflowEngine**: State machine for entity workflows
- **ValidationEngine**: Validates entity data against defined rules
- **ComputedProperties**: Manages computed/derived entity properties

### 4. API Layer

The API layer exposes entity operations through HTTP endpoints.

Key components:

- **ApiGenerator**: Generates REST API endpoints from entity definitions
- **RouteRegistry**: Manages route registration and discovery
- **ControllerFactory**: Creates controllers for entity operations
- **ApiContext**: Context for API operations
- **RequestProcessor**: Processes API requests with validation and authorization

### 5. Integration Layer

The integration layer provides connectivity with external systems.

Key components:

- **RestClient**: Client for interacting with external REST APIs
- **WebhookHandler**: Manages webhook registration and delivery
- **IntegrationRegistry**: Registry for integration configurations

### 6. UI Layer (Optional)

The UI layer provides components for building user interfaces (if applicable).

Key components:

- **Component Registry**: Registry for UI components
- **Form Generator**: Generates forms from entity schemas
- **Theme Provider**: Manages UI theming

## Key Subsystems

### Entity Management

The entity management subsystem handles entity lifecycle operations, from schema definition to data storage and retrieval.

Flow:

1. Entity configurations are loaded from YAML files
2. Entity schemas are registered with database adapters
3. EntityDao instances are created for each entity
4. CRUD operations are performed through the EntityDao

### API Generation

The API generation subsystem automatically creates RESTful endpoints for entities.

Flow:

1. Entity configurations are analyzed for API exposure settings
2. Routes are generated for standard CRUD operations
3. Custom action routes are registered
4. Routes are added to the API router
5. Request processing middleware is applied

### Action System

The action system provides a way to define and execute custom business logic on entities.

Flow:

1. Actions are defined in entity configurations
2. Action implementations are registered with the ActionRegistry
3. Actions are exposed as API endpoints or invoked programmatically
4. ActionExecutor handles action execution with transaction support

### Workflow System

The workflow system manages entity state transitions based on defined workflows.

Flow:

1. Workflows are defined in entity configurations
2. WorkflowEngine loads and validates workflows
3. Entities are initialized with workflow states
4. State transitions are performed through the WorkflowEngine
5. State change hooks are executed during transitions

### Hook System

The hook system provides extension points for customizing entity behavior.

Flow:

1. Hooks are defined in entity configurations
2. Hook implementations are loaded and registered
3. Hooks are executed at specific points in entity lifecycle
4. Hook results can modify entity data or behavior

## Service Dependencies

The framework uses a dependency injection approach through the AppContext. Key service dependencies:

- **Entity Services**:

  - EntityConfig -> ConfigLoader
  - EntityDao -> DatabaseAdapter, Logger
  - EntityManager -> EntityDao, ActionRegistry

- **API Services**:

  - ApiGenerator -> RouteRegistry, AppContext
  - ControllerFactory -> EntityDao, Logger
  - RequestProcessor -> ValidationService, AuthenticationService

- **Integration Services**:
  - WebhookHandler -> EventBus, Logger
  - RestClient -> Logger

## Data Flow

A typical data flow through the framework:

1. HTTP request received by the API layer
2. Request processed by RequestProcessor (validation, authentication, authorization)
3. Controller method invoked for the entity operation
4. Entity hooks executed for the operation (beforeUpdate, etc.)
5. Database operation performed through EntityDao
6. Entity hooks executed for post-operation (afterUpdate, etc.)
7. Response processed and returned

## Extension Points

The framework provides several extension points:

1. **Entity Hooks**: Customize entity lifecycle behavior
2. **Custom Actions**: Define domain-specific operations
3. **Plugins**: Add new functionality to the framework
4. **Custom Validators**: Define domain-specific validation rules
5. **Middleware**: Add custom request processing logic
6. **Custom Database Adapters**: Support additional databases

## Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple layers:

1. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication with role support
2. **Authorization**: Role-based access control for entities and operations
3. **Field-Level Access Control**: Control visibility and writability of entity fields
4. **Record-Level Access Control**: Filter records based on user context
5. **Input Validation**: Validate all input against defined schemas
6. **Output Sanitization**: Ensure sensitive data is not exposed

## Deployment Architecture

The framework supports various deployment patterns:

1. **Monolithic**: All components in a single application
2. **Microservices**: Components deployed as separate services
3. **Serverless**: Components deployed as serverless functions
4. **Hybrid**: Mix of deployment patterns based on requirements

## Configuration Management

Configuration is managed through YAML files:

1. **app.yaml**: Application-level configuration
2. **entities/\*.yaml**: Entity definitions
3. **workflows/\*.yaml**: Workflow definitions
4. **integrations/\*.yaml**: Integration configurations
5. **environment.yaml**: Environment-specific configuration

## Error Handling Strategy

Errors are handled consistently throughout the framework:

1. **Domain Errors**: Represent business rule violations
2. **Validation Errors**: Represent data validation failures
3. **System Errors**: Represent internal system failures
4. **Integration Errors**: Represent failures in external systems

Each error type has specific handling strategies and logging approaches.

## Logging and Monitoring

The framework includes comprehensive logging and monitoring capabilities:

1. **Request Logging**: Log all API requests and responses
2. **Error Logging**: Log all errors with appropriate context
3. **Audit Logging**: Log all data modifications for audit purposes
4. **Performance Metrics**: Track system performance metrics
5. **Health Checks**: Monitor system health

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building data-driven applications with a focus on configuration, extensibility, and maintainability. By following consistent patterns and clear separation of concerns, the framework enables rapid development while maintaining flexibility for complex requirements.
